The university project timetabling problem is a complex task faced by many universities. Solving the timetabling problem helps to create an optimal learning environment, promotes student achievements, and enhances the overall quality of graduation projects at the university.  
The problem involves three main tasks: team formation, project assignment, and project presentations and examinations. For the team formation problem, each student has a set of attributes that are related to the project, and forming a team requires a balance of those attributes within a group. As for the project assignment, the assignment is based on ranking of projects for each group based on preferences; lastly, in the project presentation/examination problem there is a set of hard and soft constraints, where examination scheduling requires satisfying all hard constraints and minimizing violations of soft constraints. 
Since these kinds of problems are usually hard to solve using conventional search methods, our proposed approach involves using heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing, since they can provide a good solution to optimization problems in a reasonable processing time in addition to handling this problem as three subproblems. Studying this problem is vital due to its impact on the quality of education and efficiency of university faculty, therefor by optimizing the handling of this problem universities can adapt collaborative learning environments, enhance student engagement and ensuring effective distribution of resources. Researchers approached this complex problem through heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms, constraint satisfaction techniques yet it remains important in academic circles due to its classification as an NP-hard problem.
